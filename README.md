# Web Builder Inspector

This is a web application built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. It serves as a web builder inspector tool, similar to the Google Chrome DevTools Inspector. The tool allows users to:

- Hover over elements to highlight them on the page.
- Click on an element to inspect its React component structure.
- View and edit the Tailwind CSS classes in real time.
- Update styles and instantly reflect changes on the page.

- **Tailwind CSS Editor**: View and edit Tailwind CSS classes in the right sidebar. Changes are applied instantly to the selected element.
- **Real-Time Updates**: As users modify Tailwind CSS classes, the changes are reflected on the page immediately.
